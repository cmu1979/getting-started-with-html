<b>Intro to Programming Notes: Stage 0!</b>
<br>
<br>
<em><b>Concept 1: What is a Web Page</b></em>
<p> A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
The World Wide Web works via a web browser makes a request via the Internet to servers using HTTP. 
Your server responds with files that your browser displays.</p>
<em><b>Concept 2: How Coding Works</b></em>
<p>Coding works when programmers write text in a language computers can understand. A computer can follow instructions that the programmer wrote.
<br>For example:
<br>
I'm <b>Learning</b> to code!
</p>
<em><b>Concept 3: Computers are Stupid</b></em>
<p>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
For example, if you forget to close a b tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. 
</p>
<p>For Example:<br>
In the below sentence, I only want the word ""handle" to be bold, but I forget to close the b tag.<br>
You can't <b>handle the truth!
</b><p>This "stupidity" can be very frustrating,
but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.  
</p>
<em><b>Concept 4: Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b></em>
<p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up at <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>!  
</p>
<em><b>Concept 5: Basic HTML Vocabulary</b></em>  
<p>We will be learning HTML in the next lesson so it will be helpful to get comfortable with the terms.  These are the most important to date.
<br>
<em>Tag</em> - An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag such as the br tag or the image tag as they do not contain contents.
<br>
<em>Element</em> - An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br>
<em>Attribute</em> - This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &lt;a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity&gt;.
